# The default ansible 'hosts' file lives in /etc/ansible/hosts 
#
# you can run a playbook with another inventory file with this command (-i <path to host file> at the end): 
# ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts 
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character 
#   - Blank lines are ignored 
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements 
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses 
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups 
 

# this file is inspired from https://github.com/dgjnpr/ansible-template-for-junos

# The 'all' group is the top of the hierarchy. 
# The ':children' suffix means that the lines below are also groups, rather than hostnames. 
# This 'all' group contains all the hosts for both sites. 
[all:children] 
site1 
site2 

# 'site1' contains all the devices in that site organised by device type 
[site1:children] 
site1_mx 
site1_qfabric

[site2:children] 
site2_mx 
site2_qfx 
site2_ex

# These groups list hosts. 
# In this fisrt example, MX devices. 
# The group name uses the format of <location>_<platoform>
# Just specify the hostname - not the FQDN

#you can assign variables to hosts that will be used later in playbooks 
[atlanta]
host1 http_port=80 maxRequestsPerChild=808
host2 http_port=303 maxRequestsPerChild=909

#Variables can also be applied to an entire group at once:
[NYC]
host3
host4

[NYC:vars]
ntp_server=ntp.atlanta.example.com
proxy=proxy.atlanta.example.com

#if the inventory file path is /etc/ansible/hosts, you can also define variables in YAML files in the directories /etc/ansible/group_vars/ and /etc/ansible/host_vars/ 
#the group_vars/ and host_vars/ directories can also exist in the playbook directory.

#if you are using roles in your playbooks, if roles/x/vars/main.yml exists, the yaml file in the subfolder vars is also used to store variables
